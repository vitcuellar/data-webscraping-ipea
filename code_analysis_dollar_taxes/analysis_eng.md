# EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
[![Leia em Português](https://img.shields.io/badge/Ler%20em-Português-blue)](analise.md)

* The USD/BRL exchange rate showed significant volatility and a trend of Real depreciation over the analyzed period (2018–2024), with projections indicating continued pressure in 2025, albeit with lower intra-annual amplitude.
* The year 2020 stood out due to the highest amplitude (R$1.92), driven by the pandemic, while 2024 recorded the highest nominal level in history (R$6.20), reflecting a period of heightened market stress.
* An analysis of annual averages, highs, and lows reveals periods of intense risk aversion and others of greater appeal for domestic assets, influenced by interest rate differentials, fiscal perceptions, trade flows, and the global macroeconomic environment.

## RETROSPECTIVE ANALYSIS (2018–2024)
Considering the chart displaying the annual average exchange rate since 2018 (see image below):

**2018 (Avg. R$3.66; Amplitude R$1.05; Min. R$3.14; Max. R$4.19):**
High volatility (R$1.05 amplitude), reflecting electoral uncertainties. 
The minimum (R$3.14) occurred early in the year, while the peak (R$4.19) coincided with heightened political uncertainty.

**2019 (Avg. R$3.95; Amplitude R$0.61; Min. R$3.65; Max. R$4.26):**
Lower volatility (R$0.61 amplitude) compared to 2018. 
The early reform agenda and the beginning of the Selic rate cuts were closely monitored. 
The peak of R$4.26 reflected moments of heightened global caution (U.S.-China tensions).

**2020 (Avg. R$5.16; Amplitude R$1.92; Min. R$4.02; Max. R$5.94):**
A year of high volatility (record amplitude of R$1.92) due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
The minimum (R$4.02) was recorded before the full impact of the crisis, while the maximum (R$5.94) reflected peak global risk aversion and expansive domestic fiscal/monetary policies.

**2021 (Avg. R$5.40; Amplitude R$0.92; Min. R$4.92; Max. R$5.84):**
Volatility persisted (R$0.92 amplitude), though lower than in 2020. 
The start of the Selic rate hike cycle aimed to curb rising inflation. 
The minimum (R$4.92) aligned with moments of optimism driven by commodity flows.

**2022 (Avg. R$5.16; Amplitude R$1.08; Min. R$4.62; Max. R$5.70):**
Volatility returned (R$1.08 amplitude). 
A high interest rate differential (with the Selic rising) and a commodity boom led to a minimum of R$4.62. 
Electoral uncertainty and fiscal fears—both global and local—pushed the rate to a maximum of R$5.70.

**2023 (Avg. R$4.99; Amplitude R$0.73; Min. R$4.72; Max. R$5.45):**
Volatility decreased (R$0.73 amplitude). 
The prolonged maintenance of a high Selic rate and the anticipation of a new fiscal framework supported the Real, which reached R$4.72. 
Episodes of heightened fiscal and external risk led to a peak of R$5.45.

**2024 (Avg. R$5.39; Amplitude R$1.35; Min. R$4.85; Max. R$6.20):**
A year marked by strong volatility (R$1.35 amplitude) and the highest nominal exchange rate in the series (R$6.20). 
Depreciation was driven by continued Selic rate cuts, narrowing the interest differential against a hawkish Federal Reserve. 
Domestic fiscal uncertainties and a strong global dollar worsened the pressure. 
The minimum of R$4.85 represented brief periods of relief or specific inflows.

Here we have the Month-Year average since 2024 to focus on the key points mentioned above:

Equally important, the highs and lows used in the amplitude and volatility analysis of the currency:

## OUTLOOK (2025)
The projected maximum (R$6.21) is similar to that of 2024, but the minimum (R$5.61) is significantly higher, suggesting a consolidation at more depreciated levels and reduced intra-annual volatility.
The continued monetary easing in Brazil and the narrowing of interest rate differentials—along with U.S. monetary policy and global growth—will be key determinants.

## MAIN RISK FACTORS AND MONITORING POINTS FOR VOLATILITY AND LEVELS:

* Credibility and execution of domestic fiscal policy: deviations from fiscal targets could exacerbate volatility and lead to sharper depreciation.

* External environment, especially commodity prices, growth in major economies (U.S., China), and geopolitical events.

* Capital flows, particularly in terms of export performance and the ability to attract foreign investment.

* Upcoming election cycles may heighten volatility due to increased uncertainty.
