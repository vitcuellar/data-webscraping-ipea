# Webscraping: IPEA DATA 

[![Leia em Português](https://img.shields.io/badge/Ler%20em-Português-blue)](README.md)

This project aims to expose my skills in handling **web scraping**. 

More than that, it is about dollar taxes (U$) in Brazilian real (R$) to analyse how some world events contributed to elevating the tax over the years. 

Also, it is a project fully developed using Python and some libraries such as ***pandas*, *bs4* and *Matplotlib***, for analyzing the graphics.

It is supposed to be an analysis that can be replicated and developed using an IDE application to construct a business report for a Financial Market company. 

So, hopefully, it would be useful to you!
